      <Description>Note that you won’t be able to use the Editor while it’s open! By default, there’s a secondary window – a console which is very useful while Debugging since you can print the output of scripts in order to see if everything is going according to what you’ve planned beforehand.</Description>

    <Page Title="Console Settings">

      <Description>This debugging setting (the console) also enables the frames per second in the window’s title – therefore, unchecking it will both disable the console and the fps.</Description>

      <Description>As shown in the previous tutorials, it’s also possible to change the Game’s resolution. All of this can also be changed in the External Settings (.ini file). This file is extremely useful to make the above changes without recompiling the project. You can also save user definitions inside as well (approached in a future lesson).</Description>
